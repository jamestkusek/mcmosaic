# MinecraftImageFilter

A fun way to stylise images.

(mainly a simple project to teach myself how to use Git)

## Description
What if you could turn images into wicked-cool minecraft-like tapestries? Look no further.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what the program can do with images of different resolutions.
(zoom in!)

### Examples
![before/after comparison of an image of toro sitting on a branch](external-resources/examples/totoro.png "before-after-totoro")

![before/after comparison of a photo of Nang Yuan island](external-resources/examples/nang-yuan.png "before-after-nang-yuan")

![before/after comparison of a photo of a valley](external-resources/examples/valley.png "before-after-valley")

![before/after comparison of a tv test image](external-resources/examples/philips-tv-test.png "before-after-philips-tv-test")

![before/after comparison of a photo of ice cube](external-resources/examples/ice-cube.png "before-after-ice-cube")

![before/after comparison of the famous photo "Lunch atop a skyscraper"](external-resources/examples/lunch.png "before-after-lunch")

## Requirements
- Java 21 or higher

- Maven 3.8 or higher

## Installation

extract zip file and install with 
```CLI
mvn clean install
```

## Usage
Use the application to add images to the input folder, transform said images and view them in the output folder
(Supported filetypes: JPEG, PNG, BMP, WBMP, GIF*)

This program works on resolutions from 1x1 up to ~15000x15000 (the latter uses a lot of resources) 

*GIF isn't properly supported yet, only a static image (first frame of GIF) is transformed. Support for the GIF format is planned in the future. Maybe.
